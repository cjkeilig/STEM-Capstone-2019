**University**: University of Nebraska-Omaha

**Faculty Advisor**: Dr. Matt Hale

**Project Scope**: Stem-ecosystem

**Project Agency(optional)**: Omaha STEM Ecosystem 

**Technical Director/External Customer**: Dr. Jenna Yentes

**Reason for wanting this project**: As individuals with an interest in STEM 
    fields, we share a vision with Omaha STEM Ecosystem in wanting to see these
    careers thrive. In order to capture that interest and get the greatest 
    benefit, it needs to start early. Offering captivating projects and
    community events can help foster young minds and grow their social circles.
    This interaction should be as seemless as possible for both the students 
    interested and the educators setting up these events. We believe this is an
    opening to provide our expertise and time for the benefit of the greater 
    good.

**Project Scope**:

This web application is securely developed for the different users such as parents, teachers, counselors and kids to figure out what camps and programs that are useful for the kids are happening in the community and also helps the parents, teachers, and counselors in figuring out what program or camp would be good for kids. Therefore, the initial plan is to implement different login and application features for each user.

For this project, the initial thoughts we had are choosing a good framework that stands for the long term. Upon the qualification and knowledge of the team members, we decided to develop a secure Django framework on the backend which supports PostgreSQL database. Since we have the different type of users such as parents, teachers, counselors, and kids we are thinking of having different user interface based on the user. For example, to the kid’s user interface we are thinking of using animations to create interest for the kids in enrolling to the camps and community programs.
