## Project Scope:

This web application is securely developed for the different users such as parents, teachers, counselors and kids to figure out what camps and programs that are useful for the kids are happening in the community and also helps the parents, teachers, and counselors in figuring out what program or camp would be good for kids. Therefore, the initial plan is to implement different login and application features for each user.

For this project, the initial thoughts we had are choosing a good framework that stands for the long term. Upon the qualification and knowledge of the team members, we decided to develop a secure Django framework on the backend which supports PostgreSQL database. Since we have the different type of users such as parents, teachers, counselors, and kids we are thinking of having different user interface based on the user. For example, to the kid’s user interface we are thinking of using animations to create interest for the kids in enrolling to the camps and community programs.
